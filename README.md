Titanic Dataset Survival Prediction

Welcome aboard, aspiring data scientists! You have been chosen to embark on a captivating voyage, delving into the Titanic dataset - a historical record of passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic. Your mission is to build a predictive model that can determine the survival outcome of passengers based on various features. The Titanic dataset contains a mix of categorical and numerical attributes, offering you a real-world challenge in implementing supervised learning algorithms. Your task is to:

Load and explore the Titanic dataset, gaining insights into its structure and contents. Analyze the distribution of features, identify missing data, and understand the relationships between various attributes.

Preprocess the data, applying one-hot encoding to categorical features and handling missing values for numerical features. Ensure the dataset is ready for model training.

Split the data into training and testing sets, where 80% will be used for training and 20% for evaluation.

Choose appropriate supervised learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, to build a predictive model. Train the model using the training data.

Evaluate the performance of your model using suitable evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on the testing set.

Fine-tune your model to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Utilize techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search for hyperparameter tuning.

Use the trained model to predict the survival outcome of new passengers with known features. Visualize the predictions and discuss insights obtained from the model.
